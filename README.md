# Customer_Churn_Prediction
The project is to check the customer churn rate of the company. Customer churn refers to the natural business cycle of 
losing and acquiring customers. Every company, no matter the quality of its products or customer service experiences churn.
Generally speaking, the less churn you have, the more customers you keep. 
Churn rate, sometimes known as attrition rate, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time. Churn may also apply to the number of subscribers who cancel or don’t renew a subscription. The higher your churn rate, the more customers stop buying from your business. The lower your churn rate, the more customers you retain. Typically, the lower your churn rate, the better. In this dataset churn rate values are assigned between 1 to 5.

We calculate churn rate as below.

For example, an early stage startup is keen on reducing its customer churn and as a Data Scientist. It is required to build a sophisticated Machine Learning Model that predicts the churn score for a website based on multiple features.
The dataset consists of parameters such as the user’s demographic details, membership account details, duration and frequency of their visits to the website reported grievances and feedback and more other parameters. Also, the training dataset consists of churn score column, that helped in model training for predicting the churn rate. I have predicted the churn rate score using the XGBoostClassifier as it was giving best accuracy compared to RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier. 
Created a website, the help in predicting the churn rate and analysis of data.
